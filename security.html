        <h1>Security Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 26.04.2025</p> 
        
        <h2>Data Protection</h2>
        <p>Typing Trainer is designed to operate fully within your browser without transmitting any data externally.
            All typing exercises, results, and interactions occur locally on your device and are not sent to any
            servers.
            This approach ensures that your activities remain private and protected from unauthorized access.</p>

        <p>We do not request personal information, create user profiles, or link usage data to identifiable individuals.
            Your experience remains entirely under your control, without hidden data collection.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>At present, Typing Trainer does not incorporate any third-party analytics, authentication systems, or
            cloud-based services.
            We aim to minimize dependencies on external providers to maintain a lightweight, privacy-respecting
            platform.</p>

        <p>In the future, if any external services (such as ad providers) are introduced, clear information will be
            provided along with options to control data sharing preferences.</p>

        <h2>Application Security</h2>
        <p>Although Typing Trainer operates purely client-side, we take proactive steps to protect against potential
            vulnerabilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All assets (code, images, libraries) are served over secure HTTPS connections.</li>
            <li>Regular code reviews are conducted to detect and patch security flaws.</li>
            <li>Dependencies are updated periodically to address known vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>Open-source libraries used within the platform are chosen carefully based on their security reputation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>While absolute security cannot be guaranteed, we are committed to maintaining a safe and trustworthy
            environment.</p>

        <h2>Vulnerability Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We highly value security researchers and the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.
            If you discover a potential issue affecting Typing Trainer, we encourage you to report it responsibly.</p>

        <p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:amtubedg@gmail.com">amtubedg@gmail.com</a> with detailed information
            about the vulnerability.
            We will prioritize investigation and remediation of legitimate reports and appreciate your efforts in
            keeping Typing Trainer secure.</p>

        <h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
        <p>Security is an ongoing process.
            We are committed to continuously improving Typing Trainer by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitoring emerging security threats,</li>
            <li>Updating libraries and code practices,</li>
            <li>Implementing user feedback regarding safety and usability.</li>
        </ul>
